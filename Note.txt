Creating Dynamic Application

The application uses an N-tier archetecture, This architecture separates the application into different layers, each with a specific responsibility, promoting separation of concerns and making the application easier to manage, test, and scale.

Presentation Layer:

Responsible for presenting the user interface and handling user interactions.


Application Layer:

- Contains the business logic of the application.
- Coordinates between the Presentation Layer and the Domain Layer.
- Provides services to the Presentation Layer and handles use cases.


Domain Layer:

- Represents the core business logic and rules.
- Contains the domain entities, value objects, and domain services.
- Isolated from other layers to ensure that business rules are centralized and reusable.

Data Access Layer (Repository Layer):

Manages data storage and retrieval.
Contains repositories and data mappers to interact with the database.
Responsible for abstracting the database access details.
